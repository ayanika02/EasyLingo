# EasyLingo
A Database Management System Project \
Made by Ayanika Bera (12) and Shreyansh Agarwal (10) \
\
Topic- Language Learning System \
\
What it does- We have compiled resources of some of the most widely spoken languages in the world. We provided resources of multiple types—certified courses, websites, and video links—and of varying difficulty for optimal use. \
\
Link on how it works (locally hosted)-    \
Github Pages link- https://ayanika02.github.io/EasyLingo \
\
Made using- HTML, PHP. Hosted on Xampp and Apache server. \

NOTE- PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) used for backend purposes is incompatible when it is hosted on Github pages. If we click on Login, Logout, About and Home, it will download the .php files instead of taking us to the respective webpage. If we click on the languages (except Hindi), we will be redirected to their respective .html files which contain all the resources. This does not work on Hindi, I had to change hindi to a .php file so that the welcome message in Hindi remains intact. This is why a video link is attached which shows how it works when its locally hosted.
